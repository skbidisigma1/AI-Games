# Spungilious Speedway - Implementation Summary

## What's Been Implemented

### ‚úÖ Track Loading System (`trackLoader.js`)
- **GLTFLoader integration**: Loads your custom "Spungilious Speedway.glb" file
- **Automatic parsing** of track elements based on mesh names:
  - `Track` ‚Üí Main driveable surface (collision + rendering)
  - `Wall` ‚Üí Collision walls
  - `Trick` ‚Üí Trick ramp zones (detection ready for future trick mechanics)
  - `Misc` ‚Üí Decorative elements (rendering only, no collision)
  - `Start.0-11` ‚Üí 12 spawn positions (currently using Start.0)
  - `Checkpoint.0-N` ‚Üí Lap checkpoints (Checkpoint.0 = finish line)
  - `Item.0-14` ‚Üí 15 item box spawn locations
  - `Dropoff.0-8` ‚Üí 9 respawn markers for falling off track

### ‚úÖ Checkpoint & Lap System (`checkpoint.js`)
- **Lap counter**: Tracks current lap (1-3 by default)
- **Checkpoint validation**: Must pass through all checkpoints for lap to count
- **Finish line logic**: Only counts if all checkpoints passed
- **Lap timing**: Tracks individual lap times and total race time
- **Race completion**: Detects when all 3 laps are finished
- **Smart respawn tracking**: Remembers last checkpoint/dropoff passed

### ‚úÖ Item Box System
- **Visual item boxes**: Golden rotating cubes at all 15 Item.X locations
- **Collision detection**: Automatically detects when kart touches item box
- **Auto-respawn**: 5-second timer before item boxes reappear
- **Animation**: Rotation + vertical bobbing effect
- **Item distribution**: Gives random item when collected (uses existing ItemManager)

### ‚úÖ Respawn System
- **Manual respawn**: Press `T` to respawn at last checkpoint
- **Automatic respawn**: Falls below Y=-10 triggers auto-respawn after 0.5s
- **Intelligent positioning**: Respawns at last checkpoint OR dropoff point passed
- **Proper orientation**: Faces correct direction based on checkpoint rotation
- **State reset**: Clears velocity, drift state, and boosts on respawn

### ‚úÖ Game Integration
- **Removed procedural track**: No more flat plane + guardrails
- **Custom track rendering**: Full 3D track from your GLB file
- **Dynamic shadow configuration**: Extended shadow camera for larger tracks
- **UI updates**: 
  - Lap counter: "Lap: 1/3 | Checkpoints: 0/12"
  - Respawn hint: "Press T to respawn"
  - Track name in overlay: "Spungilious Speedway"

## üéÆ How It Works

### On Game Start:
1. Loads `Spungilious Speedway.glb`
2. Parses all track elements and sorts them by index
3. Creates visual item boxes at Item.X locations
4. Spawns kart at Start.0 position and rotation
5. Initializes checkpoint manager and starts race timer

### During Race:
1. **Every frame checks**:
   - Is kart touching a checkpoint? ‚Üí Update lap progress
   - Is kart touching a dropoff marker? ‚Üí Update respawn point
   - Is kart touching an item box? ‚Üí Collect item, hide box for 5s
   - Is kart below Y=-10? ‚Üí Trigger auto-respawn
   - Did player press T? ‚Üí Manual respawn

2. **Lap completion logic**:
   - Checkpoint.0 (finish line) crossed
   - All checkpoints have been passed since last lap
   - ‚Üí Complete lap, reset checkpoint tracking, start next lap

3. **Item boxes**:
   - Active: Visible, rotating, bobbing
   - Collected: Invisible, 5s countdown
   - Respawned: Back to active state

## üîÆ What's Ready for Future Features

### Trick System (Detection Ready)
- `trackLoader.isOnTrickZone(position)` method exists
- Returns true when kart is on Trick meshes
- Just need to add:
  - Button input detection (e.g., arrow keys during air time)
  - Trick animations (flips, spins)
  - Boost rewards for successful tricks

### Walls (Basic Collision)
- Currently uses simple track bounds
- Wall meshes are loaded and available in `trackData.walls[]`
- Can be enhanced with:
  - Per-mesh collision detection using raycasting
  - More accurate bounce angles based on wall normals

### Visual Enhancements
- Item box model can be replaced with custom GLB
- Checkpoint markers can be visualized (currently invisible)
- Trick ramp highlights/glow effects
- Particle effects for item collection

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Collision Detection**: Currently using simplified bounding box collision
   - Doesn't use actual wall mesh geometry yet
   - May allow clipping through complex wall shapes
   - Enhancement needed: Raycasting or physics engine integration

2. **Trick Ramps**: Detection works, but no trick mechanics yet
   - Can detect when on ramp
   - Need to add: aerial trick inputs, scoring, boost rewards

3. **Item Distribution**: Random items for now
   - Should be position-based (better items when behind)
   - Need probability tables based on race position

4. **Multiplayer**: Single player only
   - All 12 Start positions available but unused
   - Checkpoints work but no opponent tracking

## üìä Console Output

When playing, you'll see helpful logs:
```
[TrackLoader] Loaded track: ./assets/track/spungilious_speedway/Spungilious Speedway.glb
[TrackLoader] Parsed track: { checkpoints: 13, dropoffs: 9, starts: 12, items: 15, trickZones: X }
[TrackLoader] Item boxes created: 15
[CheckpointManager] Race started
[CheckpointManager] Passed checkpoint 1 (1/13)
[CheckpointManager] Lap 1 complete! Time: 45.23s
LAP 1 COMPLETE! Time: 0:45.230
[Vehicle] Respawned at checkpoint
```

## üéØ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Track loads without errors
- [ ] Kart spawns at Start.0 location
- [ ] Can drive around track
- [ ] Checkpoints register when passed
- [ ] Lap counter increments after passing all checkpoints + finish line
- [ ] Item boxes appear at Item.X locations
- [ ] Item boxes disappear when collected and respawn after 5s
- [ ] Random item awarded on collection
- [ ] Press T to manually respawn
- [ ] Falling off track triggers auto-respawn
- [ ] Respawn position is at last checkpoint/dropoff passed
- [ ] Race finishes after 3 complete laps

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test the track** and report any issues with:
   - Checkpoint placement (are they in the right spots?)
   - Respawn positions (do they face the right direction?)
   - Item box locations (are they accessible?)
   - Trick ramp zones (do they cover the ramps properly?)

2. **Implement tricks** when you're ready:
   - I can add aerial trick detection
   - Button inputs during flight (‚Üë‚Üì‚Üê‚Üí for different tricks)
   - Speed boost rewards
   - Visual spin/flip animations

3. **Visual polish**:
   - Better item box models
   - Checkpoint arch/gate visuals
   - Particle effects
   - Track-specific lighting/atmosphere

4. **Additional tracks**:
   - Same structure works for any track
   - Just change the file path in `game.js`
   - Could add track selection menu
